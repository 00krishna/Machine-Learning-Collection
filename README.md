# Machine Learning Collection
In this repository I will be uploading machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. I try to make them as clear as possible, for some I have done video explanations on youtube and derivations on my blog.

If the algorithm is tested: :white_check_mark
If the algorithm is untested: :small_red_triangle:
Link to Blogpost: :scroll:
Link to Video: :tv:
Also, for many I will be uploading a theory part or derivation for the algorithm on my blog then it will be a link with .
